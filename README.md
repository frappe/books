    <br/>

### Under the Hood

- **Vue.js**: In Frappe Books, Vue.js powers the front-end, enabling a reactive and component-based UI. It ensures seamless interactions and dynamic updates, giving users a modern, responsive experience.

- **Electron**: Electron is used to package Frappe Books as a standalone desktop application, allowing it to run offline and provide a native-like experience across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

- **SQLite**: Frappe Books uses SQLite as its local database. All financial data, transactions, and configurations are stored securely in an SQLite file on the user's machine.

## Production Setup

### Manual

Download and install the latest release for your platform from the [releases
page](https://github.com/frappe/books/releases) .

### Using Homebrew (for MacOS and Linux)

```zsh
brew install --cask frappe-books
```

### Via Flatpak (Linux)

    <img width='120' alt='Get it on Flathub' src='https://flathub.org/api/badge?locale=en'/>
</a>

## Development Setup

### Pre-requisites

To get the dev environment up and running you need to first set up Node.js `v20.18.1` and npm. For this, we suggest using
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

Next, you will need to install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).

### Clone and Run

Once you are through the Pre-requisites, you can run the following commands to
setup Frappe Books for development and building:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/frappe/books.git

# change directory
cd books

# install dependencies
yarn
```

To run Frappe Books in development mode (with hot reload, etc):

```bash
# start the electron app
yarn dev
```

**Note: First Boot**

When you run `yarn dev` electron will run immediately but the UI will take a
couple of seconds to render this because of how dev mode works. Each file is
individually served by the dev server. And there are many files that have to be
sent.

**Note: Debug Electron Main Process**

When in dev mode electron runs with the `--inspect` flag which allows an
external debugger to connect to port 5858. You can use chrome for this by
visiting `chrome://inspect` while Frappe Books is running in dev mode.

See more [here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/debugging-main-process#external-debuggers).

#### Build

To build Frappe Books and create an installer:

```bash
# start the electron app
yarn build
```

**Note: Build Target**
By default the above command will build for your computer's operating system and
architecture. To build for other environments (example: for linux from a windows
computer) check the _Building_ section at
[electron.build/cli](https://www.electron.build/cli).

So to build for linux you could use the `--linux` flag like so: `yarn build --linux`.
