    <img width='120' alt='Get it on Flathub' src='https://flathub.org/api/badge?locale=en'/>
</a>

### Using Homebrew (for MacOS and Linux)

```zsh
brew install --cask frappe-books
```

### Manual

Download and install the latest release for your platform from the [releases
page](https://github.com/frappe/books/releases) .

## Development

Frappe Books is built on Vue.js and Electron. It is offline by default and uses
a local SQLite file as the database.

### Pre-requisites

To get the dev environment up and running you need to first set up Node.js `v20.18.1` and npm. For this, we suggest using
[nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating).

Next, you will need to install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable).

### Clone and Run

Once you are through the Pre-requisites, you can run the following commands to
setup Frappe Books for development and building:

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/frappe/books.git

# change directory
cd books

# install dependencies
yarn
```

#### Development

To run Frappe Books in development mode (with hot reload, etc):

```bash
# start the electron app
yarn dev
```

**Note: First Boot**

When you run `yarn dev` electron will run immediately but the UI will take a
couple of seconds to render this because of how dev mode works. Each file is
individually served by the dev server. And there are many files that have to be
sent.

**Note: Debug Electron Main Process**

When in dev mode electron runs with the `--inspect` flag which allows an
external debugger to connect to port 5858. You can use chrome for this by
visiting `chrome://inspect` while Frappe Books is running in dev mode.

See more [here](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/debugging-main-process#external-debuggers).

#### Build

To build Frappe Books and create an installer:

```bash
# start the electron app
yarn build
```

**Note: Build Target**
By default the above command will build for your computer's operating system and
architecture. To build for other environments (example: for linux from a windows
computer) check the _Building_ section at
[electron.build/cli](https://www.electron.build/cli).

So to build for linux you could use the `--linux` flag like so: `yarn build --linux`.

## Remote Database Connection

Frappe Books now supports connecting to a remote database when importing an existing database. Follow the steps below to configure and use the remote database connection feature:

1. Open Frappe Books and navigate to the "Database Connections" section.
2. Click on "New Database Connection" to add a new remote database connection.
3. Fill in the required details:
   - **ID**: A unique identifier for the database connection.
   - **Database type**: Select the database type (e.g., SQL Server).
   - **Authentication method**: Choose the authentication method.
   - **Connection String**: Enter the connection string for the remote database.
   - **Connection timeout (ms)**: Specify the connection timeout in milliseconds (optional).
   - **Request timeout (ms)**: Specify the request timeout in milliseconds (optional).
4. Click on "Test Connection" to verify the connection details.
5. If the connection is successful, click "Save" to save the remote database connection.
6. You can now use the remote database connection when importing an existing database.
